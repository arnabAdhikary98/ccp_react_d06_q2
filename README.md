## Weather Dashboard React App

This project is a simple weather dashboard built with React and Vite. It allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions using the OpenWeatherMap API. A Google Map is also embedded for the searched city.

### Features
- Search for weather by city name
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition
- Shows a Google Map of the city

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid) and [Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key).
4. Replace the placeholder API keys in `src/pages/Weather.jsx` with your own keys.
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Notes
- Make sure to use valid API keys for both OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps.
- If you see an error like `Invalid API key`, update your API key in the code.
